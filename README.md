# 🏦 Loan Default Classification

A machine learning project designed to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to **default** or **not default** based on historical financial and demographic data.  
This project helps financial institutions reduce risk and make informed lending decisions through data-driven insights.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate multiple classification models to determine the likelihood of loan default.  
The project includes:

- Data preprocessing  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature scaling (optional)  
- Training ML models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - (Optional) XGBoost  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Saving the best performing model  
- Using the trained model to predict new applicants
